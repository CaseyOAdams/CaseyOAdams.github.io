        <p>My experience at CSU has opened my eyes to the world of technology. Together with my core classes such as English, science, Biblical classes, languages, history, and computer classes it has allowed me to gain a wealth of knowledge that I will continue to use for the rest of my life. My journy at CSU has made me hungry for more knowledge and helped to realize I will always be learning something new. Technology is my passion and CSU was key in shaping me in the right direction when it comes to seeking a career in technology. </p>

        <h2>My Presentations</h2>
        <p>The following presentations are from my cyber security class, CSCI 405. This class gave me a solid foundation of cyber security principles and techniques. I was familiarized with past cyber security attacks and how to prevent attacks in the future.</p>

        <p>The following two links will show projects I completed in CSCI 433, Network Security.</p>
        <p>Ansible Playbooks are a key feature of Ansible, a popular open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Playbooks are written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) and define a series of tasks that Ansible should execute on a group of managed nodes (servers, devices, etc.).
Playbooks allow administrators to define the desired state of their systems. They can be used to install software packages, configure system settings, manage users and groups, and perform other system administration tasks. The first link shows how I implemented Ansible to configure Apache.</p>
        <p>Bash scripting is a powerful and versatile tool for automating routine tasks, enhancing productivity, and ensuring consistency in system administration and development environments. By writing scripts in Bash, users can automate repetitive tasks such as file management, system updates, and application deployments, significantly reducing the potential for human error and saving time. Bash scripts are particularly useful in Unix-like operating systems, where they can leverage the extensive suite of command-line tools and utilities available. Moreover, Bash scripts enable users to string together complex sequences of commands, making it easier to perform sophisticated operations that would be cumbersome and error-prone if done manually. Their simplicity and accessibility make Bash scripts a valuable skill for system administrators, developers, and power users alike, fostering greater efficiency and reliability in managing and interacting with systems.

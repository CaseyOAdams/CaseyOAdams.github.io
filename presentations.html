        <h2>My Presentations</h2>
        <p>The following presentations are from my cyber security class, CSCI 405 in fall 2023. This class gave me a solid foundation of cyber security principles and techniques. I was familiarized with past cyber security attacks and how to prevent attacks in the future.</p>

        <p>The following two links will show projects I completed in CSCI 433, Network Security in fall of 2022.</p>
        <p>Ansible Playbooks are a key feature of Ansible, a popular open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Playbooks are written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) and define a series of tasks that Ansible should execute on a group of managed nodes (servers, devices, etc.).
Playbooks allow administrators to define the state of their systems. They can be used to install software packages, configure system settings, manage users and groups, and perform other system administration tasks. The first link shows how I implemented Ansible to configure an Apache server.</p>
        <p>Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating routine tasks, enhancing productivity, and ensuring consistency by system administrators. By writing scripts in Bash, users can automate tasks such as file management, system updates, and application deployments, reducing human error and saving time. Bash scripts are particularly useful in Unix-like operating systems, where they can leverage the extensive command-line tools and utilities available. Moreover, Bash scripts enable users to string together complex sequences of commands, making it easier to perform sophisticated operations. The bash script link shows a project I completed where you can ask questions and get different responses based on the questions. </p>
